# Mendix Bootstrap Input Addons Widget

This widget extends form controls by adding text on either side of textual input's (as described on http://getbootstrap.com/components/#input-groups).

This would be useful when working with constant values that always apply on a field, for example the 'â‚¬' symbol when working with currencies.

To use the widget, place it in a Entity context (like a dataview) and configure the widget's properties.

## Features
* Add text before, after, or on both sides of any text-based input
* (Optional) show the label of an input field
* (Optional) set field as required

## Limitations
* Buttons, checkboxes, radiobuttons and dropdowns (as add-on) are not yet implemented
